## What is it

A simple community boilerplate to replicate Algolia websites like InstantSearch*.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Node.js >= v9.2.0, use nvm - [install instructions](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script)
- Yarn >= v1.3.2 - [install instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#alternatives-tab)

## Initial setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:algolia/community-project-boilerplate.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:algolia/my-project.git
yarn
yarn docs:update
git add docs README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m 'first commit'
git push
```

## Publish docs to https://community.algolia.com/my-project

You need to activate GitHub pages for your repository (in settings on GitHub), choose "master branch /docs folder".

Every time you want to update your production website, do:

```sh
yarn docs:update
git add docs README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m 'docs(update): something'
git push
```

At some point this will be moved to Netlify.

## Local development

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Go to https://localhost:3000. There should be auto reload for almost everything, but when it fails just restart the server.

## Changes to be done before going live

- Rename any folder and replace any occurence of `community-project-boilerplate` to `my-project`.
- Remove `meta(name='ROBOTS', content='NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW')` from [src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/layouts/common/meta.pug](./src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/layouts/common/meta.pug).

## Project structure

- Pages (index, about..) are in [src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/src](./src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/src)
- Layouts are in [src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/layouts](./src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/layouts)
- JS and images are in [src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/assets](./src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/assets)
- Stylesheets are in [src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/src/stylesheets](./src/community-project-boilerplate-docgen/src/stylesheets)

## Assets and links references

To reference assets and links from any HTML page in this website, always reference them from the root of the website, without any leading "." or "/". Links from HTML pages are always relative to the root of your website, not the current file.

To ease hosting on different subpaths (https://community.algolia.com/website/ and http://localhost:3000/), we use a [`<base href>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) tag that allow us to easily achieve that.

If your image is in `assets/images/image.png` then you can reference it in your HTML page like that: `<img src="assets/images/image.png" />` and it will always work no matter how the website is hosted.

Same for linking to a particular page, if you are in `index.html` (or `index.md`), to link to `about/team.html` just do this: `<a href="about/team.html">team</a>`.

For ressources inside CSS files, always use relative paths from the CSS file itself like `background-image: url("../assets/image/image.png")`);
